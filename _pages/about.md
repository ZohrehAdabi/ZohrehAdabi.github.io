Welcome to my GitHub.io page! I'm Zohreh Adabi Firuzjaee, a PhD candidate researching deep learning, probabilistic inference and Bayesian neural networks. I am passionate about advancing the capabilities of deep learning models.

During my Master's degree, I focused on meta-learning, few-shot learning, and Gaussian processes. Through hands-on projects and research, I gained valuable experience in developing approaches to tackle the challenges of learning from limited data and making interperatable predictions.

My current research as a PhD student revolves around optimization and probabilistic inference, where I explore cutting-edge techniques to model complex data distributions, incorporate prior knowledge, and make principled decisions. I am particularly interested in the intersection of Bayesian methods and deep learning, aiming to combine the power of neural networks with the uncertainty quantification provided by probabilistic modeling.
